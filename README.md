Systemin perception and signaling rely on the systemin receptor SYR1. However, SYR1-dependent signaling, and how systemin signaling differs from other peptide-mediated signaling pathways, is largely unknown.
This experiment contained WT and syr1(systemin receptor knockout) cell culture treated by systemin.Samples were harvested at 0,1,2,5,15,45 min and each time point had 6 biological replicates.
